OVERALL FEEDBACK:
Good looking app, but a bit dark!  
I was able to see everything through the video and running the app but no need to make things too mysterious.  
But yeah I get it it's a horror thing!

Each shader looks to have its own complexities and visual interactions with several different combinations of effects. 
Really it's a shader showpiece which is great. Input and mouse controls feel good and solid. 
Given the horror theme you should have added a spooky noise or something!

Essentially the hole texture is procedural texturing which is actually what we will be looking at next semester so this is really above and beyond. 
With a technical focused demonstration like this the expectation is for technical detail and explanation in the report and it is well written, extensive and complete. 
The diagrams are also an excellent addition for clarity. 
All techniques and underlying principles used are well understood.  
Excellent work all round and you will have more chance for exciting procedural textures next semester!
